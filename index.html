<em>How Internet Works</em><br>
<p>I pay my cable bill, that's how.<br>(my sense of humor is lame)<br>Browser on my computer connects to the Internet (if I paid my cable bill) by typing the URL of a website, which in turn connects to a server using HTTP protocol. Servre finds the appropriate HTML doc and sends it back to my computer.</p>
<em>HTML basics</em><br>
<p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. 
Markups are tags. E.g., "b" tag makes text <b>bold</b>, and "em" is for <em>italics</em>.
Void tags are tags that don't require a closing tag (that's the one with a "/" at the end of a piece of text that you want to apply your tag to).</p>
<em>Whitespace</em>
<p>Two types of tags are <i>inline</i> and <i>block</i> tags. Unlike inline tags, block tags (e.g. "p" tag I'm using for this very paragraph) actually create a box around the text they are applied to.</p>
<em>Computers are Stupid</em>
<p><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-sad-computer-1.html">This is a picture of a computer that's sad because I just called it stupid.</a> Sorry, computer!<br>
Anyway, computers are stupid because we have to tell them <em>exactly</em> what to do. It won't understand you if you made a syntax error. <br> Always check your work! (if you are still not sure, ask a human for help)
